### Questions

> Run the commands sort, wc and uniq on the commands.js file. Explain how they
work and what the output was.

A:
sort- returns the lines of a file alphabetized
output of "sort bash.js":
"
commands.evaluateCmd(userInput);
userInput = userInput.toString().trim();


// The stdin 'data' event triggers after a user types in a line
//evaluateCmd is a function which will be implemented in commands.js
//prompt the user for input
});
const commands = require("./commands.js");
process.stdin.on('data', (userInput) => {
process.stdout.write('prompt > ');
"

wc- outputs a count of newline chars, a word count, and byte count for a filename
output of "wc bash":
"
11  44 376 bash.js
"

uniq- compares subsequent lines in a file for complete matches. For any complete
matches, the subsequent line is removed.
output of 'uniq bash.js':
"
$ uniq bash.js
const commands = require("./commands.js");

//prompt the user for input
process.stdout.write('prompt > ');

// The stdin 'data' event triggers after a user types in a line
process.stdin.on('data', (userInput) => {
  userInput = userInput.toString().trim();
//evaluateCmd is a function which will be implemented in commands.js
  commands.evaluateCmd(userInput);
});
"

> Using the pipe (|) connect at least two commands and run it on commands.js. Explain what the output was and why the specific data was outputted.

A: 
output of "uniq commands.js | wc":
$ uniq commands.js | wc
     46     103    1054

6. In this checkpoint, you encountered built-in JavaScript methods as well as the new ES6 syntax. Review the information below before attempting the programming challenge.
Given a string, reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while maintaining the original word order and whitespace and return the string. To improve your problem-solving experience, use the suggested functions to solve the problem.

A:
```
function reverseString(input){
  var reversedArr = [];
  stringArr = input.split(' ');
  stringArr.forEach((item) => {
        reversedArr.push(item.split("").reverse().join(''));
  })
  console.log(reversedArr.join(' '));

}

reverseString("I'm learning to program algorithms!");
```
